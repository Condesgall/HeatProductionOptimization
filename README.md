# HeatProductionOptimization

This project was developed as a project during the second semester of first year of our Bachelor of Science program in Software Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark.

A heating optimization application for Danfoss, incorporating four production units. The application allows the user to optimize heating production based on net costs, CO2 emissions or both. Users can visualize the results through a graph or a csv file, providing clear insights for efficient heating management.
